# Introduction
In 1998 NDHS gathered information on immunization coverage for all children born within the five years including their vaccination of Tuberculosis (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio. The birth order, residence and mother's education level shows a strong relation to the infants' ? immunization rate. The earlier birth order, urban residency and higher mother's education benefit the health of newborns. To enhance further vaccine equality and ensure every infants receive full immunization at the recommended
time, NDHS should probably promote the awareness of the infant's family in importance of immunization.
# Data Source
The 1998 NDHS gathered information on immunization coverage for all children born within the five years before the survey to aid in the national evaluation of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), which includes the whole population of the nation. Tuberculosis (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio are especially investigated in the survey.
