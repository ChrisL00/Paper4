# Introduction
In 1998 NDHS gathered information on immunization coverage for all children born withinthe five years including their vaccination of Tuberculosis (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio. The birth order, residence and motherâ€™s education level shows a strong relation to the infantsâ€? immunization rate. The earlier birth order, urban residency and higher motherâ€™s education benefit the health of newborns. To enhance further vaccine equality and ensure every infants receive full immunization at the recommended
time, NDHS should probably promote the awareness of the infantâ€™s family in importance of immunization.
# Data Source

Tuberculosis (BCG), measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), and polio are especially investigated in the survey.
